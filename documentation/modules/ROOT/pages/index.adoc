This solution pattern integrates a number of open source technologies to create a solution that ingests and summarizes
near real-time stock data. It mimics how a human would analyze and summarize financial information from 
a variety of companies that trade on the NYSE and NASDAQ markets.
It is intended to be used as a starting point for your own solution.
